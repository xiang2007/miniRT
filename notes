1. Cast ray to scene, and find where it land on
2. Cast a ray from that point towards each light source to determine which light illuminates that point
3. If the surface is reflective, cast a new ray in that direction to detemine what color is reflected there

tuple
w = 1 is a point
w = 0 is a vector

point - point = vector
vector - point = point
vector - vector = vector

subtracting is determined by w value

negating tuple is used if wanted to know the opposite of some vector

multiplication and division
-> To see what point lies nth time farther in that direction

magnitude
-> How far you would travel in a straight line, the distance represent by vector
-> Vector with a magnitude of 1 is called a unit vector

normalization
-> Taking an arbitary vector and convert it into a unit vector (magnitude of 1)

dot product (basically multiplication)
-> takes 2 vector and returns a scalar value
-> the smaller the product, the larger the angle between the vectors
-> if the dot product of 2 vector is 1, they are identical
-> if the dot product of 2 vector is -1, they point in opposite direction

cross product
-> Takes 2 vector and return another vector
-> Get a new vector that perpendicular to both of the original vector

identity matrix
-> You'll get the same matrix when multiplied with the identity matrix
-> Can use as the default transformation for any object

transpose matrices
-> Translation certain vector (normal vector) btw object space and world space
-> Its column turned into row, row turned into column

determinant
-> Determinant is to determine whether or a system has a solution
-> If determinant is 0, no solution

submatrices
-> submatrix is what left when one col and one row is removed
-> reduced the size of matrix by 1, 4x4 -> 3x3 matrix

manipulating minor matrices
-> find the submatrix at the given locantion, then compute the determinant
